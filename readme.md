## Introduction

Project 1 of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive involves
constructing a browser Trivia Game. The game is two-player, with each player alternating between answering questions.

# Technologies Used for this Project
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- jQuery

## Steps
- Using contentful, I created an API with several questions, four answer options, and a correct answer. Using ajax I pulled this API to my code so I could use the data for my project.
- Using jQuery and Alex Merced's video series resource on building jQuery browser games, I created the framework for a two-player trivia game.
- Once the game was set up, I began editing the CSS properties to make the game more visually pleasing. This included creating borders and border styles for the divs.

# Challenges
Initially, due to the placement of input on contentful, the correct answer for every question was located in the same place. At first I tried fixing this in my jQuery code, before deciding to fix the problem at the source on contentful.
